# Day 6->9 Neobyte

### Requests:

#### Day 9. Create comprehensive README files for each project

- Each README should include detailed instructions on how to install the necessary dependencies and set up the development environment.

#### Day 8. API Health Checker

Create a project to monitor if the API is up and running. The API is one of your project, example: localhost:3000/api/products  
Project requirements:

- Log downtimes in a log file
- Log uptimes in a log file

#### Pattern:

- [timestamp] + Response Status Code + API is up/down . + response time.

**Example:**
**[2023-07-21 12:08:02] 200 API is up, response time 282 ms**
